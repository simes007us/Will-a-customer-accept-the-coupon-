Report: Comparing Bar vs. Coffee House Coupon Acceptance
Overall Acceptance

Bar coupons were accepted only 41% of the time, well below the dataset’s overall acceptance rate (~57%).

Coffee House coupons landed at about 50% acceptance, a more even split between yes and no.

Bar Coupons

Strongly linked to lifestyle habits. Only people who already go to bars frequently (>3 times a month) showed high interest (~73% acceptance).

Older adults (over 25) were far more likely to accept compared to younger drivers.

Family and context matter: those with kids in the car or who were widowed rarely accepted.

Occupation mattered: drivers outside of “Farming, Fishing & Forestry” were significantly more receptive.
In short, bar coupons mostly appeal to established, social adults who already frequent bars.

Coffee House Coupons

Much broader appeal. Acceptance hovered near 50% across the board, with strong upticks among regular coffee drinkers (visiting 4+ times/month → 65–69% acceptance).

Younger drivers (<21) were most likely to accept (~70%), suggesting coffee shops are popular with students and young adults.

Social context matters here too: acceptance was higher with friends or partners, lower when alone.

Income split: both low-income groups and upper-middle income earners ($87K–$100K) accepted more often, while drivers in the $75K–$87K range were least interested.
Coffee coupons appeal to a younger, more social demographic and cut across both budget-conscious and well-off groups.

Key Differences

Bar coupons are niche: they work mainly on older, frequent bar-goers in social settings.

Coffee coupons are broader: popular with younger drivers, regular coffee drinkers, and those out with friends/partners.

Takeaway:
Bar coupons are best targeted to known frequent bar-goers, while coffee coupons can be marketed more widely — especially to younger, social drivers or frequent coffee house visitors.
